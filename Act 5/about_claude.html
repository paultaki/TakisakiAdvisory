            <p class="career-path">
              At 18, I was closing sales at a mall kiosk. By 30, I led 180+ people across five states at a Fortune-ranked company. By 40, I was commanding a 450-person national org of engineers, strategists, and customer success specialists.
            </p>
            <p class="achievement-record">
              Along the way: 14 job interviews. 14 offers. I've never been told no. I was the #1 Senior Director in B2B Sales four times in seven years—across three separate territories I personally turned around. My teams generated over $1B in new revenue, including $200M from my first Senior Director role through 22% subscriber growth.

          <h2>The Handlebar Test</h2>
          <div class="handlebar-story">
            <p>
              Remember riding a bike without handlebars as a kid? That first moment feels like certain doom—your heart races, your stomach drops, and every instinct screams to grab hold again. But if you resist that impulse, something magical happens: the bike continues forward with remarkable stability, and you experience a freedom unlike anything before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leadership requires this same counterintuitive leap. When I took over struggling territories, I didn't tighten control—I let go of the handlebars. I delegated 80% of decisions, focused on the vital few metrics, and trusted my team's strengths.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result? Historic records broken. Top-line revenue up 37% year-over-year. Net customer additions up 96%. And for the first time, a team that came to work energized, aligned, and ready to win.

            <h3>The 80/20 Leadership OS</h3>
            <p>Identify what actually moves the needle, focus ruthlessly, and ignore the noise. When you're not chasing every metric, you master the critical few.</p>

            <div class="framework-expanded">
              <p>I asked my team: "Will you get fired if you don't deliver on this metric?" For 80% of what consumed their time, the answer was no.</p>
              <p>I communicated clearly: "If we can be the best in these 3-4 metrics, I'll cover you on the other 15; you won't even hear about them."</p>
              <p>The result: Record-breaking performance without burnout. We focused on what actually mattered, ignored the rest, and outperformed every other team in the company.</p>

              <p>I booked 1:1s with every single employee, starting at the edge. No agenda—just their story, their pain points, their ideas.</p>

              <p>The result: Trust built at speed. Problems surfaced that leadership never knew existed. Solutions that worked because they came from the people closest to the work.</p>

            <h3>Strategic ROI-Driven Initiatives</h3>

            <button class="expand-btn">See More</button>
            <div class="framework-expanded">
              <p>I developed a cupcake program that finance thought was ridiculous—until it delivered a 10x ROI during the pilot phase.</p>
              <p>I turned customer success from a cost center into a revenue-protection engine that saved $53M+ in its first year.</p>
              <p>The result: Programs that scaled because they paid for themselves, creating a virtuous cycle of investment and return.</p>
