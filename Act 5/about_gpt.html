            <h2>The Climb</h2>
            <p>
              I started in a mall kiosk, learning to sell by watching body language and closing deals before most people trusted me to drive. I didn’t rise through titles—I rose by solving problems nobody else wanted. My ascent wasn’t linear. It was built in fire.
            </p>
            <p>
              By 30, I was leading five states. By 40, I ran a 450-person national org of engineers, strategists, and consultants. At every step, I simplified what others overcomplicated—and the results followed.

          <!-- THE SHIFTS -->
          <div class="about-shifts animate-ready">
            <h2>5 Beliefs That Define Me</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Quiet Confidence Outperforms Loud Urgency.</strong> Real leaders don’t need to posture.</li>
              <li><strong>The Handlebar Test Wins.</strong> Let go. Trust your team. Watch them fly.</li>
              <li><strong>Focus on the Critical Few.</strong> Measure what matters. Ignore the rest.</li>
              <li><strong>Systems Beat Heroes.</strong> Design frameworks that scale without you.</li>
              <li><strong>Antifragile Culture Is the Goal.</strong> Pressure should strengthen your org, not crack it.</li>
            </ul>

          <!-- THE PLAYBOOK -->
          <div class="about-playbook animate-ready">
            <h2>What I Deploy</h2>
            <p>
              My vault holds 100+ frameworks: quota redesigns, incentive systems, influence maps, cultural rewires, and operating models tested in the field. I don’t sell templates. I deploy only what fits.

            <h2>Why It Works</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>19 straight growth months in a hyper-competitive region</li>
              <li>$53M in churn saved with a new customer success model</li>
              <li>National adoption of my quota system years after I left</li>

            <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
            <p>
              I work with operators. Founders. Fixers. Executives on the hook for performance and culture. I’m not for those chasing vague inspiration—I’m for those ready to pull the lever.
