## Summary
Conducted comprehensive link audit and fixed all broken/incorrect links across the entire site.

## Critical Fixes Applied

  - Mobile menu: Changed "Take Action" to "Contact"
  - Desktop nav: Updated Contact link
- ✅ Fixed Insights links from `/insights/insights.html` to `/insights/`

### 2. About Page (about.html)

### 3. Contact Page (contact/index.html)

### 4. Insights Pages (all blog posts)

  - Changed `src="images/logo-shadow.png"` to `src="/images/logo-shadow.png"`
- ✅ Fixed all relative links from `insights.html` to `/insights/`
  - Updated in boring.html
  - Updated in wrong-plane.html
  - Updated in invisible-resume.html

## Link Structure Now Follows:
- Main sections use directories with trailing slash: `/contact/`, `/services/`, `/insights/`
- Individual pages use .html: `/about.html`, `/leadership-accelerator.html`
- All internal links use absolute paths starting with `/`

## Verified Working Links:
- ✅ `/` (homepage)
- ✅ `/about.html`
- ✅ `/contact/` → `/contact/index.html`
- ✅ `/services/` → `/services/index.html`
- ✅ `/insights/` → `/insights/index.html`
- ✅ `/insights/boring.html`
- ✅ `/insights/wrong-plane.html`
- ✅ `/insights/invisible-resume.html`

## External Links Verified:
- ✅ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/paultaki/ (with trailing slash)
- ✅ Twitter/X: https://x.com/PaulTakisaki
- ✅ Medium: https://medium.com/@paul_31198
- ✅ Crunchbase: https://www.crunchbase.com/person/paul-takisaki-bc76

## Remaining Considerations:
1. Consider implementing 301 redirects for old URLs:
   - `/insights/insights.html` → `/insights/`
   - `/services.html` → `/services/`
   - `/contact.html` → `/contact/`

2. Update vercel.json to handle these redirects

3. Consider standardizing all pages to either:
   - All use directories (`/about/` instead of `/about.html`)
   - Or all use .html files
   
Currently mixed approach but functional.

## Total Links Fixed: 15+
All critical navigation and content links are now working correctly.
