        <h2>The Backstory</h2>
        <p>
          From mall kiosk to AVP. From burnout to builder. From strategy decks
          to family dinners. Iâ€™ve led broken teams, reimagined broken systems,
          and built cultures that win.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve created national models, saved $50M in churn, led record growth
          streaks, and mentored dozens who rose far beyond what they thought
          possible. Now, Iâ€™m building for legacy.
