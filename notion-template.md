# PAUL TAKASAKI'S LEADERSHIP PLAYBOOK IN NOTION
## Template Structure for Easy Reference During Coaching

---

### DATABASE SETUP GUIDE

To make your leadership playbook highly usable in Notion, I recommend setting up a database rather than a traditional document. Here's how:

1. Create a new page in Notion
2. Type `/database` and select "Table - Full page"
3. Name it "Leadership Playbook"

### DATABASE PROPERTIES

Set up these properties for each leadership concept:

| Property Name | Property Type | Options |
|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Name | Title | (default) |
| Category | Select | Leadership Philosophy, First 90 Days, Structural Transformation, Talent Development, Performance Systems, Sales & Customer Engagement, Innovation, Communication, Leadership Development, Personal Disciplines | 
| Tags | Multi-select | Create tags as you go (see suggested tags below) |
| Application Context | Multi-select | 1:1 Meetings, Team Meetings, Executive Presentations, Performance Reviews, Strategy Sessions, Crisis Management, Change Implementation, Coaching Sessions |
| Implementation Timeline | Select | Quick Win (Days), Short-Term (Weeks), Medium-Term (Months), Long-Term (Quarters+) |
| Impact Level | Select | Individual, Team, Department, Organization, Company-Wide |
| Key Quote | Text | A memorable phrase that captures the essence |
| Related Concepts | Relation | Connect to other concepts in your playbook |

### TEMPLATE FOR EACH CONCEPT

For each concept entry, create this template structure:

```
## [Concept Name]

### Core Principle
[One sentence that captures the fundamental idea]

### Key Elements
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]

2. **Quick Reference**: Filter by "Quick Win" implementation timeline for concepts you can coach on immediately
3. **Situation Based**: Group by "Application Context" to quickly find concepts relevant to specific situations
4. **Impact Focus**: Sort by "Impact Level" to prioritize concepts with broader organizational effects

### SAMPLE ENTRY EXAMPLE

Here's how one concept would look fully filled out in your database:

**Name:** The Invisible Hand Strategy Development

**Category:** Innovation

**Tags:** Chess thinking, Strategic planning, Team ownership, Facilitation

**Application Context:** Strategy Sessions, Team Meetings

**Implementation Timeline:** Medium-Term (Months)

**Impact Level:** Department

**Key Quote:** "When people believe they created the strategy, they execute it with passion rather than compliance."

**Related Concepts:** Playing Chess Not Checkers, Strategic Communication

```
## The Invisible Hand Strategy Development

### Core Principle
When people believe they created the strategy, they execute it with passion rather than compliance.

### Key Elements
- Prepare Your Vision: Develop your complete strategic framework in advance
- Structured Discovery: Create a process that guides the team toward key insights
- Targeted Questioning: Use questions to direct thinking without dictating conclusions
- Synthesis Facilitation: Help the team connect their insights into a coherent whole
- Ownership Transference: Position the final strategy as the team's creation

### Strategic Implementation
Before strategic planning sessions, develop your complete framework with key elements defined. Instead of presenting this framework directly, design a facilitation process that guides the team through structured discovery. Ask questions like "What would a winning position in this market look like?" and "Where should we focus our resources for maximum impact?"

As the team generates ideas, guide the synthesis toward the framework you've envisioned, but allow for genuine improvements based on team insights. The resulting strategy will align with your vision while incorporating valuable team perspectives. Most importantly, the team will champion the strategy as their own creation, dramatically increasing execution quality and organizational buy-in.

### Common Pitfalls
- Being too rigid about your pre-developed framework, missing genuine improvements
- Appearing manipulative rather than facilitative if your guidance is too heavy-handed
- Rushing the process and not allowing sufficient discovery time
- Not giving genuine credit to team contributions that improve the strategy

### Coaching Questions
- How would you balance maintaining strategic direction while creating genuine ownership?
- What questions could you ask that would lead the team toward crucial strategic elements?
- How would you handle suggestions that differ significantly from your vision?

### Success Indicators
- Team members proactively advocate for the strategy with their own teams
- Strategy execution proceeds with minimal resistance and high engagement
- Team references the strategy as "our approach" rather than "the company's plan"

### Resources
- Book: "Playing to Win" by A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin
- Case Study: National Quota Model Implementation

### GETTING STARTED STEPS

1. Create your Notion database with the properties outlined above
2. Set up the template for concept entries
3. Create the first 5-10 key concepts to test the structure
4. Create your different views (by category, application context, etc.)
5. Add tags as you go to improve searchability
6. Set up related concept links after you've added several entries

This template structure will make your leadership playbook a living, searchable resource that you can easily reference during coaching sessions and continue to build upon over time.
