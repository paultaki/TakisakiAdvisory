## Phase 1: Human Introduction (Weeks 1–2)

**Objective**: Build trust through vulnerability and strength discovery.

### Task: Authentic Introduction

**Why**: Teams follow stories, not titles. Share yours to value strengths.

**Tactics**:
- Share a personal struggle (e.g., starting at a mall kiosk, balancing family) with photos (family, hobbies).
- Admit limits: “I’m here to amplify your strengths, not fix you.”
- Express excitement: “I joined to build on what you’re great at.”

**Example Script**:  
> “I’m Paul, a father of three who started selling phones door-to-door, doubting I’d make it. I’ve felt your pressures. Leadership is about unlocking your best work. I’m here to discover your strengths and build together. What’s your story?”

### Task: Frontline 1:1 Immersion

**Why**: Uncover truths and talents to transform teams.

**Tactics**:
- **Small Teams (<100)**: Meet all employees (20-minute sessions).
- **Large Teams (100+)**: Use stratified selection (25% high-potentials, 25% random, 25% problem areas, 25% self-nominated).
- Ask:
  - What energizes you most? (Strengths)
  - What are you better at than anyone else? (Strengths)
  - If you could redesign your role, what would you do more of? (Strengths)
  - What’s working well that we should protect?
  - What’s one thing you’d change with a magic wand?
  - What do you think is the best approach to [key issue]? (Reflective)
- Take notes, thank sincerely: “Your strengths will shape our win.”
- Track patterns and strengths in Strength Mapping Tracker.

**Emotional Triggers**:
- Don’t flinch at hard truths. Respond with curiosity: “Tell me more.”
- End with gratitude: “Your talents are our foundation.”

### Tool: Strength Mapping Tracker

**Description**: Excel template to log:
- Name, role, department
- Strengths (energizing tasks, self-perceived excellence, e.g., “Storytelling”)
- Pain points (e.g., “Complex reporting”)
- Influencers (e.g., “Jane, trusted by team”)
- Realignment suggestions (e.g., “Move Sarah to client engagement”)
- Impact estimate (e.g., “20% engagement boost”)

**How to Use**:
1. Enter 1:1 data weekly.
2. Sort by strengths to identify 1–2 realignment opportunities (e.g., “John: Analysis → Data Lead”).
3. Sort by pain points for 3 top issues (e.g., “Simplify reporting”).

## Phase 2: Intelligence Gathering (Weeks 3–4)

**Objective**: Diagnose the organization, map strengths, and prioritize metrics.

### Task: Diagnose Territory

**Why**: Tailor your approach to team needs, leveraging strengths.

**Tactics**:
- Assess team state:
  - **Turnaround**: Declining metrics, low morale. Rebuild trust via strengths.
  - **Growth**: Plateaued metrics, untapped potential. Leverage strengths for ambition.
  - **Stability**: Solid results, inefficiencies. Align strengths to systems.
  - **Startup**: Chaos, big dreams. Anchor strengths to processes.
- Tools:
  - Review 12–24 months of data (sales, retention, engagement).
  - Combine 1:1 insights (strengths, pain points) with customer feedback.
  - Apply “Will I get fired?” test to select 3–5 vital metrics (e.g., revenue growth, engagement).

**Example**: Low morale, stable market share → Prioritize engagement (turnaround) via strength realignments, focus on retention metric.

### Task: Meet 10–20 Customers

**Why**: External insights align with team strengths, build credibility.

**Tactics**:
- Observe sales calls, don’t lead.
- Meet diverse clients (happy, frustrated).
- Ask:
  - What’s working in our relationship?
  - What would you change?
  - What are your biggest challenges?
  - How do competitors approach you?
- Debrief with reps, using reflective questions: “What did you notice?” “What’s one change you’d prioritize?”
- Track insights in Leadership Assessment Template.

### Task: Engage Influencers

**Why**: Informal leaders amplify your vision through their strengths.

**Tactics**:
- Identify via 1:1s (e.g., who’s mentioned as trusted?).
- Meet solo, ask: “What am I missing?” “What do you think we should prioritize?”
- Position as win leaders (e.g., a storyteller for communication).
- Credit input: “Your perspective shaped this approach.”

### Task: Triangulate Truth

**Why**: Disconnects reveal leverage points for strengths and priorities.

**Tactics**:
- Compare 1:1 themes (strengths, pain points) with leadership reports.
- Probe gaps without blame: “I hear reporting frustrates reps but works for managers. What’s your take?”
- Use insights to align priorities in all-hands.

### Tool: Leadership Assessment Template

**Description**: Word template to analyze:
- Individual strengths and realignment opportunities (e.g., “Sarah: Relationship-building”)
- Team strengths and gaps
- Operational bottlenecks (e.g., “Slow approvals”)
- Cultural assets/liabilities
- Market position, competitive threats
- Quick win opportunities
- Vital few metrics (3–5 priorities)

**How to Use**:
1. Fill post-1:1s and customer meetings.
2. Use Strength Alignment Matrix (table) to visualize role fit (e.g., “Current Role vs. Strength-Based Role”).
3. Identify 1–2 realignments and 3 vital metrics.

**Download**: paultakisaki.com/downloads/assessment.docx

## Phase 3: Early Win (Weeks 5–8)

**Objective**: Deliver strength-based wins and simplified processes to cement buy-in.

### Task: Secure Visible Wins

**Why**: Actions prove you value strengths, signaling “This time, it’s different.”

**Tactics**:
- Review 1:1 and customer patterns for pain points and strengths.
- Pick 2–3 wins that are:
  - Solvable in 30 days
  - Impactful to most
  - Visible and tied to feedback
- Prioritize:
  - **Role Realignments**: Move team members to strength-based roles (e.g., rep from admin to client engagement).
  - **Simplification**: Consolidate complex processes (e.g., merge conflicting reports).
  - Other: Kill unnecessary approvals, fix broken tools.
- Announce wins: “You said reporting was complex. Sarah’s analytical strength simplified it.”
- Celebrate publicly: “This win came from your talents.”

**Example**: In the Pacific Northwest, realigning a marketing manager to competitive intelligence (their strength) boosted growth by 27% in Q2.

### Task: Hero Request

**Why**: Solve a longstanding “no” to prove you prioritize strengths.

**Tactics**:
- Identify a denied request from 1:1s (e.g., role shift, better tools).
- Approach gatekeepers (e.g., Finance): “I need one win to show we value strengths. Can we make this work? You get the credit.”
- Deliver and credit gatekeepers publicly.

**Example**: Overhauled Verizon’s Rules of Engagement by creating PODs, leveraging a team’s coordination strengths, reducing confusion and boosting sales cycles.

### Task: Pilot Calibration Calls

**Why**: Share strength-based wins to break silos and build ownership.

**Tactics**:
- Start weekly 30-minute calls with influencers or key team members.
- Agenda:
  - Highlights: 1–2 wins (e.g., role realignment, how achieved).
  - Opportunities: 1 challenge, planned fix.
  - Round-robin: “What’s one peer insight you’ll implement?”
- Use reflective questions: “How can [peer’s win] amplify your strengths?”
- Track commitments in Win Progress Tracker.

**Example**: Sharing a simplified reporting process across teams increased adoption, reinforcing collaboration.

### Tool: Win Progress Tracker

**Description**: Excel template to track:
- Win description (e.g., “Simplified reporting”)
- Type (realignment, simplification)
- Impact (e.g., “Saved 1 hour/day”)
- Timeline, owner
- Feedback loop (announcement plan)
- Calibration call commitments (e.g., “Team B adopts process”)

**How to Use**:
1. Update weekly with win details.
2. Share progress in calibration calls to sustain momentum.
3. Announce completed wins in team huddles.

## Phase 4: Strategic Direction (Weeks 9–12)

**Objective**: Inspire a strength-driven vision and operationalize it with focused metrics.

### Task: Develop and Communicate Vision

**Why**: Teams need a “why” rooted in their strengths to rally behind.

**Tactics**:
- Use Five Question Strategy Model:
  1. What’s our winning aspiration? (e.g., lead with unmatched talent)
  2. Where will we play? (e.g., enterprise, not SMB)
  3. How will we win? (e.g., leveraging team strengths)
  4. What capabilities do we need? (e.g., strength-aligned roles)
  5. What systems support this? (e.g., vital few scorecards)
- Integrate Vital Few Scorecard: Highlight 3–5 critical metrics (e.g., “These are our must-wins. Your strengths get us there.”).
- Communicate 7 times in 7 ways:
  - All-hands: Share stories of strength-based wins.
  - 1:1s: Tie vision to individual strengths.
  - Visual map: Show strengths and metrics.
  - Email: Summarize for skeptics.
  - Team huddles: Reinforce weekly.
  - Stories: Highlight Pacific Northwest turnaround.
  - “Why” document: 1-pager summarizing vision.
- Send 3 handwritten notes post-all-hands: “Your strength in X shaped our path.”

### Task: Establish Implementation

**Why**: Vision requires strength-based ownership and a clear rhythm.

**Tactics**:
- Set roles and accountabilities tied to strengths (e.g., “Sarah leads client engagement”).
- Conduct weekly check-ins (10 min progress, 10 min wins, use calibration call format).
- Track vital few metrics in Vital Few Scorecard.
- Use AMAs and pulse surveys, asking: “How do your strengths contribute to this vision?”

### Task: All-Hands Reveal

**Why**: Close the feedback loop to show strengths and priorities shape strategy.

**Tactics**:
- Share 1:1 themes: “You told us X, Y, Z.”
- Quote anonymously: “One of you said, ‘I’m best at Z.’ We’ve realigned to leverage that.”
- Outline changes: “We’re focusing on these 3 metrics, driven by your strengths.”
- Be realistic: “We can’t fix everything, but your talents set our course.”
- End with: “This is our plan, built from your strengths and truth.”
- Follow up: Drop into meetings, share a 2-minute video reflecting on a strength-based win.

### Tool: Vital Few Scorecard

**Description**: Excel template to track:
- 3–5 critical metrics (e.g., revenue, engagement)
- Leading indicators (e.g., customer meetings)
- Status (red/yellow/green)
- Owner, next steps
- Shield plan (e.g., “Ignore these 10 metrics”)

**How to Use**:
1. Define metrics in Phase 2, update weekly in Phase 4.
2. Review in calibration calls, share in all-hands to reinforce focus.
3. Use shield plan to protect team from trivial metrics.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Overload**: Don’t chase every issue. Focus on strengths and vital metrics.
- **Rushing**: Map strengths in Weeks 1–2 before acting.
- **Defensiveness**: Hard truths are tests. Ask: “What’s your take?”
- **Overpromising**: Be transparent about limits to build trust.
- **Ignoring Strengths**: Realign roles, don’t fix weaknesses.

---

## Success Metrics

- 80%+ 1:1 completion (100% for small teams, stratified for large).
- 10–20 customer meetings completed.
- 2–3 early wins (at least 1 strength-based realignment).
- Vision communicated 7 ways, 70%+ team clarity (via survey).
- 3–5 influencer relationships built.
- Vital few metrics defined and tracked.
- At least 1 role realigned to strengths.

---

## For Large Organizations

- **Scale 1:1s**: Use quarterly rotation (25% high-potentials, 25% random, 25% problem areas, 25% self-nominated).
- **Maximize Travel**: Work from open desks, join team lunches to connect with frontline.
- **Stay Visible**: Share weekly videos, host AMAs, and run pulse surveys on strengths.
- **Track Patterns**: Centralize insights in Strength Mapping Tracker, share anonymized strength maps quarterly.

## Case Studies

### Pacific Northwest Turnaround

**Challenge**: A dysfunctional team missed targets for seven quarters, with rock-bottom morale and siloed operations.

**Solution**: Instead of firings, I conducted 1:1 strength assessments, asking: “What energizes you?” and “What are you best at?” I realigned roles (e.g., marketing manager to competitive intelligence, leveraging analytical strengths) and simplified processes (e.g., consolidated conflicting reports).

**Results**:
- Q2: Exceeded targets by 27%.
- Q3: Led nationally in growth metrics.
- Engagement: Rose from bottom quartile to top 10% company-wide.
- Team Feedback: “I’m finally doing what I’m good at.”

**Lesson**: Aligning roles to strengths unlocks potential without disruption.

### Desert Team Transformation

**Challenge**: A “challenging” team with low morale, poor customer satisfaction, and siloed operations lagged nationally.

**Solution**: I spent one month on 1:1 strength assessments, asking: “What part of your job gives you energy?” and “What would you double down on?” I redesigned roles (e.g., admin to campaign lead, leveraging storytelling) and focused on 3 vital metrics (revenue, customer adds, engagement), shielding teams from trivial noise.

**Results**:
- Q2: Exceeded targets by 27%.
- Year-End: 37% revenue growth, 96% increase in customer adds.
- Engagement: Top 10% company-wide.
- Team Feedback: “I’m doing what I’m built for.”

**Lesson**: Strengths and focus drive exponential results.
