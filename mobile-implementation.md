# Mobile Experience Implementation Guide

## Overview
The new mobile experience has been designed to create an emotionally resonant, high-performance website that feels exceptional on mobile devices. These files create a comprehensive solution that addresses navigation, forms, animations, accessibility, and performance.

## Files Created

1. `mobile-master.css` - A complete mobile-first stylesheet
2. `mobile-experience.js` - JavaScript enhancements that bring the experience to life
3. `mobile-implementation.md` - This implementation guide

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Link the CSS and JS files

Add the following to the `<head>` section of your HTML files:

```html
<!-- Mobile Experience Enhancement -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mobile-master.css">
<script src="mobile-experience.js" defer></script>
```

### Step 2: Add CSS classes to enable animations

For scroll reveal animations, add the `scroll-reveal` class to any element you want to animate in as the user scrolls:

```html
<div class="testimonial-card scroll-reveal">
  <!-- Card content -->
</div>
```

### Step 3: Update form elements

For forms that should use the enhanced mobile styles:

```html
<form class="enhanced-form">
  <!-- Form fields -->
</form>
```

### Step 4: Create accordion elements (optional)

To create collapsible content sections:

```html
<div class="accordion-item">
  <div class="accordion-header" aria-expanded="false">
    <h3>Section Title</h3>
    <span class="accordion-icon">+</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <!-- Content here -->
  </div>
</div>
```
