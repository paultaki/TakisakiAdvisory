        Reps were calling me begging to switch teams. HR was drowning. Directors
        wouldn't speak. I had to rebuild belief, fast.

          <li>Zero mission, zero unity, zero psychological safety</li>
          <li>HR investigations + passive-aggressive sabotage</li>
          <li>Reps skipping managers to talk to me directly</li>

            <strong>📝 Reset the Mission:</strong> Unified mantra: "Build the
            team everyone wants to join." Reps helped write it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>🤝 Forced Collaboration:</strong> Paired rivals, created
            "Truth Room" sessions, praise requirements across teams.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>☎️ Opened Frontline Access:</strong> Took every call, 3
            layers down. "Paul listens" spread like wildfire.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>🧠 Strategic Coaching:</strong> Rewired leaders to stop
            asking me. New loop: "What do your peers think?"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>🛏️ Cut Poison, Not People:</strong> Named and cleared out
            toxic behaviors. Some self-selected out.
