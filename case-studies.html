            <h2 class="case-title">From Flawed to Fair: National Quota Model Transformation</h2>

<p>
  When I inherited a broken quota system that punished top performers and rewarded underperformers, 
  I designed a revolutionary four-dimensional model that balanced fairness, business needs, and psychological motivation. 
  The model was so successful that it was later adopted as the national standard for all B2B sales teams across the organization.

                  "Paul's quota redesign was a game-changer. It aligned
                  incentives with potential and gave my team clarity on what
                  success looked like. Most importantly, it felt fair."
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>
                I set out to build a quota model that balanced potential,
                effort, and performance while removing excuses. After analyzing
                data across my seven-state region—territory size, customer
                density, historical results, and rep feedback—I landed on a
                four-part framework:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Territory Potential (40%)</strong> - Divided
                  territories into five zones based on opportunity: market
                  maturity, industry presence, and growth trends.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Zip Code Complexity (10%)</strong> - Accounted for
                  geographic sprawl. More zip codes meant more travel time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Active Lines / Existing Customer Base (30%)</strong> -
                  Recognized that more current customers meant more upsell and
                  cross-sell opportunities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Performance Influence (20%)</strong> - Allowed past
                  performance to shape quotas, but with guardrails.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                This wasn't just a spreadsheet tweak—it was a behavioral reset.
                The model aimed to keep the top 20% motivated and unleashed,
                give underperformers a fair shot without escape hatches, and
                align quotas with business priorities, not just past results.
              </p>

              <p>
                A model this nuanced wouldn't stick without clear, consistent
                communication. Messaging became as critical as the math...

                <p>
                  When I took over leadership of the Field Enablement
                  organization, I inherited more than a mess—it was a
                  battlefield of misaligned incentives, scattered support, and
                  zero clarity. Sales reps were drowning in 87 disconnected
                  documents and support teams were competing for credit instead
                  of collaborating.

                  It was especially damaging during the Fixed Wireless Access
                  (FWA) product push—a massive growth opportunity that was
                  falling flat due to confusion around positioning, technical
                  validation, and execution. The rules of engagement (ROE) were
                  a full page of font size 7 that no one actually followed.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Enablement Function Launch</strong> - Created a team

                Cracking Churn: A Proactive Model for Retention at Scale

              <div class="preview-content">
                <p>
                  Churn was hiding in plain sight. New B2B customers were
                  falling off not during the sale—but afterward. I built a
                  proactive retention strategy designed to reduce risk, increase
                  engagement, and drive long-term loyalty across the customer
                  lifecycle.

                    “This system turned customer success into a discipline—not a

                  </p>
                </div>

                <h3>The Approach</h3>
                <p>
                  I led the design and rollout of a CX playbook focused on
                  post-sale engagement. We created clarity around customer
                  milestones, deployed proactive communication strategies, and
                  embedded feedback loops to catch risks early and respond fast.
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Churn Signal Tracking:</strong> Built a dashboard
                    surfacing usage gaps, support friction, and implementation
                    delays.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Named Success Leads:</strong> Clients were assigned
                    internal advocates to ensure momentum and value realization.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Milestone-Based Check-Ins:</strong> Defined journey
                    stages at activation, ROI realization, and contract renewal.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Real-Time CX Loop:</strong> Created a system for
                    sharing client insights across support, product, and sales
                    teams.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                  The strategy not only cut churn in half—it transformed how
                  teams thought about retention. It made customer loyalty a
                  shared goal, with shared accountability, and measurable
                  outcomes.

              <div class="preview-content">
                <p>
                  In an era of dashboards and KPIs, I maintained an "unscalable"
                  commitment to personal connection—holding regular 1:1s with
                  people three layers down in my 400-person organization. The
                  results speak for themselves.

                  Leadership at scale is a trap. The bigger things get, the
                  easier it is to hide behind dashboards, reports, and filtered
                  feedback. You get polished presentations. You get secondhand
                  updates. You get just enough truth to feel informed—but not
                  enough to feel connected.
                </p>
