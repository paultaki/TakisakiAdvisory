            <h3>Work Smarter</h3>
            <p>
              Efficiency isn't laziness—it's evolution. You weren't failing. You
              were filtering. You weren't too much. You were too early.
            </p>

            <h3>Skip the Fire Drills</h3>
            <p>
              Save energy for what actually matters. The same "ADHD" behavior
              that derailed you in school becomes an executive superpower once
              you have autonomy.

            <h3>Delegate to Multiply</h3>
            <p>
              Release control to release capability. You don't delegate to do
              less—you delegate so others can do more. This isn't a disorder.
              It's a different OS.

          I provide the framework that elevates both your team and career to
          unprecedented heights. Together, we won't just meet expectations—we'll
          shatter them.

          <div class="approach-item reveal-up">
            <h3>See the whole board.</h3>
            <p>
              Don't just react to symptoms—diagnose the system. Uncover hidden
              friction, invisible ceilings, and leadership contradictions that
              block growth. Walk away with insight you can't unsee—and a clear
              path forward.

            <h3>Build playbooks from the trenches.</h3>
            <p>
              Every tool is battle-tested. These aren't fluffy frameworks.
              They're the same plays used to lead 400+ in one of the most
              complex orgs at Verizon—strategies that scaled nationally and
              broke records.

          <div class="approach-item reveal-up">
            <h3>Create clarity out of chaos.</h3>
            <p>
              Most execs are drowning in noise. Cut through it by identifying
              your "critical few" metrics, aligning your org behind them, and
              ditching the trivial many. Less spinning. More winning.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="approach-item reveal-up">
            <h3>Rewire how you lead.</h3>
            <p>
              You won't leave with more to do—you'll leave with less. Less
              control. Less reactivity. More delegation, more leverage, more
              <em>freedom</em>. It's not about optimizing your calendar—it's
              about building a system that doesn't need you to be the hero.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="approach-item reveal-up">
            <h3>Lead with belief, not pressure.</h3>
            <p>
              People don't rise for KPIs. They rise for someone who sees them.
              Unlock this skill so your team becomes self-correcting, not just
              compliant. Stop chasing performance—and start attracting it.
            </p>

          <div class="approach-item reveal-up">
            <h3>Transform, not just inform.</h3>
            <p>
              Real executives need more than information—they need
              transformation. Your mental models about leadership will be
              reconstructed from the ground up. When you walk out, you won't
              just think differently—you'll act differently, without having to
              remember what you learned.
