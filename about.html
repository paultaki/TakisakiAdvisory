            <p class="intro-tagline">I don’t fix leaders—I weaponize them.</p>
            <p class="intro-lead">
              Strategic Operator. Human Diagnostic Engine. Trusted by the top 1%. I dismantle chaos, extract leverage, and rebuild elite systems—fast. No frameworks. No fluff. Just signal.
            </p>
            <p class="career-path">
              Within minutes, I surface blind spots most leaders ignore for quarters—and convert them into strategic launch points. What I deliver isn’t advice. It’s irreversible momentum.
            </p>
            <p class="career-path">
              As AVP, I led a 450-person technical org—Solutions Architects, Product Specialists, and Engineers—built to accelerate B2B sales execution across five distribution channels. We partnered with HQ end-to-end—strategy, finance, product, GTM, operations, and AI teams—to translate planning into execution, and execution into feedback that shaped what came next. We trained 3,000 reps, co-sold complex deals, and embedded technical depth into every customer conversation. If we didn’t drive it, it didn’t move.
            </p>
            <p class="achievement-record">
              14 interviews. 14 offers. Turnover in my orgs was negligible—because people don’t leave winning teams where their edge is valued, their voice matters, and growth is engineered—not left to chance. I turned around three underperforming territories and was ranked #1 Senior Director in B2B Sales four times in seven years—across three different markets. Teams I built generated hundreds of millions in new revenue, including $200M from one transformation through 22% subscriber growth.
            </p>
            <p class="humility-note">
              I’m not the loudest in the room. I listen, ask the right questions, and show people the power they didn’t know they had. It’s never been about me.
            </p>
            <p class="farewell-recognition">
              When I retired from my 20-year career, the CRO, 7 Vice Presidents, and 8 Senior Directors sent me off with a farewell video—joined by over a dozen Directors across the business. Results mattered. So did how I led.
            </p>
            <p class="closing-line">
              I work with leaders who can’t afford to guess—and don’t have time to fail. I upgrade executive operating systems in weeks—not quarters—and architect unfair advantages competitors can’t copy.
            </p>
            <p class="final-strike">
              If you’re still deciding, the drag is already compounding. Delay is the cost. I’m the countermeasure.

          <h2>The Handlebar Test</h2>
          <div class="handlebar-story">
            <p>
              Remember riding a bike without handlebars as a kid? That first moment feels like certain doom—your heart races, your stomach drops, and every instinct screams to grab hold again. But if you resist that impulse, something magical happens: the bike continues forward with remarkable stability, and you experience a freedom unlike anything before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Leadership requires this same counterintuitive leap. When I took over struggling territories, I didn't tighten control—I let go of the handlebars. I delegated 80% of decisions, focused on the vital few metrics, and trusted my team's strengths.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result? Historic records broken. Top-line revenue up 37% year-over-year. Net customer additions up 96%. And for the first time, a team that came to work energized, aligned, and ready to win.
