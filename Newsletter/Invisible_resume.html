    <h1>âš¡ The Invisible Resume Is Real (And You're Writing It Daily)</h1>
    <p><strong>by Paul Takisaki</strong></p>

    <p>
      Iâ€™ve never lost a job I applied for.<br />
      14 for 14. No plan Bs. No second-place stories.
    </p>

    <p>
      But none of those roles were won because of a bullet point on a resume.<br />
      They were won in parking lots, red-eye flights, on the sales floorâ€”when
      someone <em>saw</em> how I showed up.
    </p>

    <p>Thatâ€™s the <strong>invisible resume</strong>.</p>

    <p>
      Itâ€™s not your LinkedIn headline. Itâ€™s what people say when you leave the
      room.<br />
      Itâ€™s who you are when the spotlightâ€™s off.
    </p>

    <p>Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your invisible resume starts when thereâ€™s
        <em>nothing in it for you</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        People remember <em>how</em> you lead, not just <em>what</em> you did.
      </li>
      <li>Legacy shows up in the quiet impact you almost forget you made.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A few weeks ago, someone I barely remembered mentoring said this:</p>

    <blockquote>"Youâ€™re the reason I didnâ€™t quit."</blockquote>

    <p>
      Not because I gave them a playbook.<br />
      Because I <em>noticed</em> them. I asked better questions. I made space.
    </p>

    <p>
      And honestly? Thatâ€™s the stuff that lasts.<br />
      Numbers fade. Impact echoes.
    </p>

    <p>So ask yourselfâ€”right now:</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Whatâ€™s showing up on your invisible resume this week?</strong
      ><br />
      Who did you fight for? Who got better because of you?<br />
      Whoâ€™s going to tell a story about you years from now... because you took a
      minute to care?
    </p>

    <p><strong>Thatâ€™s the game Iâ€™m playing.</strong></p>

    <p>
      More soon.<br />
      â€”Paul

      You can. I actually read them.

      <h3>ðŸ“† Future topics Iâ€™m working on:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          How I got 400 people to trust meâ€”and why that still wasnâ€™t enough
        </li>
        <li>The <em>Flywheel vs. Treadmill</em> approach to leadership</li>
        <li>Why my best ideas came after I stopped pushing</li>
