# Performance Optimizations Completed ✅

## Date: January 10, 2025

### 1. Analytics Scripts Optimization ✅
**All Pages Updated:**
- Changed Google Analytics from `async` to `defer`
- Wrapped gtag initialization in `window.addEventListener('load')`
- Wrapped Twitter tracking in `window.addEventListener('load')`

**Impact:** Analytics no longer block initial page render

### 2. Image Lazy Loading ✅
**Images Updated:**
- Footer logo now has `loading="lazy"` attribute
- SVG icons use data URLs (no benefit from lazy loading)

**Impact:** Reduced initial page load

### 3. Scroll Event Optimization ✅
**Homepage Updated:**
- Implemented `requestAnimationFrame` throttling
- Prevents excessive JavaScript execution during scroll
- Maintains smooth scroll progress bar animation

**Impact:** Reduced main thread blocking during scroll

### 4. Vercel Caching Configuration ✅
**Headers Added:**
- Images: 1 year cache (immutable)
- CSS/JS: 1 year cache (immutable)
- HTML: No cache (must-revalidate)
- WebP images: 1 year cache (immutable)

**Impact:** Returning visitors load instantly from cache

## Expected Performance Improvements
