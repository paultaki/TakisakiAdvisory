      <h2>FAQs</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-grid">
      <details>
        <summary>Do you only work with executives?</summary>
        <p>
          I work with established executives, rising leaders, and high-potential
          managers ready to accelerate their growth. The common thread is
          ambition, openness to growth, and a desire to lead with purpose and
          impact. My clients range from directors preparing for VP roles to
          executives looking to expand their influence and legacy.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What if I’m not ready for a VP role?</summary>
        <p>
          Great. Coaching isn’t just about the next job—it’s about becoming the
          kind of person that next job demands.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How long is the commitment?</summary>
        <p>
          Month-to-month, with most clients working together 3–9 months. No
          long-term contracts.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Is this confidential?</summary>
        <p>
          Always. Trust is the foundation—and everything we discuss stays
          between us.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What if I struggle with imposter syndrome?</summary>
        <p>
          You’re not alone. Like most high performers, I’ve been there too. I
          help you turn that self-doubt into clarity and conviction, so you can
          show up with both confidence and humility. You don’t need to fake it.
          You need to lead from what's already true in you.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you coach people outside tech?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. While many clients come from SaaS, telco, and enterprise sales,
          the coaching is leadership-focused and industry-agnostic.
