# **Play Chess, Not Telephone: How I Built Org-Wide Trust and Moved Messages That Actually Landed**

After transforming four underperforming markets, earning President’s Cabinet four times, and building teams that ran so efficiently it felt like I wasn’t even working, I sat down to document how I did it. The truth? I put the work in up front to smooth the path later.

I’ve watched countless leaders burn themselves out swinging a dull axe. They put in more hours and worked harder than everyone around them, but never quite broke through. Meanwhile, I sharpened the blade. I built systems rooted in trust, influence, and strategic communication.

This isn’t luck. It’s a different game entirely.

Here’s how I played chess with communication, while everyone else was stuck playing telephone.

## The Real Problem With Corporate Communication

Most execs think communication is about saying something once or twice and then expecting that message to get carried cleanly to the frontlines. But that’s not how it works, not even close.

In reality, it’s more like the game of telephone. A message starts as “baby elephants can weigh 20 pounds” and ends up as “a baby punched a mailbox.” It sounds ridiculous, but in a corporate setting, the distortion isn’t funny, it’s expensive.

Now add in personal agendas, competing priorities, pushback, cultural differences, and a lack of trust, and you’ve got misalignment. That’s why I stopped playing telephone and started playing chess.

## My First Wake-Up Call:

In my first official leadership job, I asked my team to build a slide for our upcoming staff meeting. I explained the format, told them what to cover, asked if they understood, and I saw every head nod.

“Great,” I thought, “this leadership thing is easy.”

Next meeting rolls around—and it was a mess. Some built slides, some forgot, some said I never asked, and nobody delivered what I had in mind. I sat there thinking, what is wrong with them?

That night, I called the man I trust most for counsel—my dad. He laughed, not out of disrespect, but knowing exactly the rookie mistake I’d made. Then he said something that would forever shape my communication style:

> “Son, in leadership, if it’s important—you’ve got to say it seven times and seven different ways.”
>

That was the day I learned: clarity is the leader’s burden, not the team’s. If the message doesn’t land, you can’t blame the receivers; you have to change your delivery. That principle became the backbone of how I communicated going forward.

Here’s how I rewired the org chart to reflect my new mindset visually and operationally.

## My Communication Playbook: Trust + Timing + Tactical Influence

Here’s what I built instead: a trust-first, influencer-driven communication model that doesn’t rely on hope. It relies on strategy.

### Step 1: Build the Plan

I don’t just roll out top-down directives. First, I draft the plan with my direct reports. We stress-test it, poke holes in it, and make sure it’s grounded.

### Step 2: Identify Influencers

In most teams, there’s at least one unofficial leader. The person everyone looks at before deciding if they should buy in. It’s not always the highest performer, it might be the most vocal, most experienced, or the one bold enough to play devil’s advocate in a room full of peers.

I can spot them quickly. I listen during team roundtables and watch who everyone else watches.

### Step 3: Private Buy-in

Once we have a first draft, I pull the influencers in one-on-one. Always privately, never in a group. I say something like:

> “I trust your opinion, and I know others do too. I’d love your feedback on this.”
> 

They push back less in 1:1 settings. No need to posture. Sometimes their feedback is legit. Sometimes it’s just a tweak to feel heard. Either way, I’ll listen, and adjust if needed, then I ask:

> “So do you think this will work?”
> 

Then comes my key move:

> “Your peers look up to you. Could you do me a favor and help get them on board? Just share why you think it works and what my intent is.”
> 

They always say yes, and they carry my message farther and faster than I ever could.

### Step 4: Roll It Out With Built-In Advocates

Now, when I share the plan org-wide, I’m not alone. The influencers are aligned and championing it in side convos and team huddles. It’s not just my voice carrying the message, it’s theirs too.

If you skip this approach, you risk public pushback. And if the influencers pushback, everyone else follows. You’ve already lost the room.

### Step 5: Reinforce With Presence

I don’t sit in corner offices when I visit remote offices. I plop down right in the cubicle and pull out my laptop. The reaction is always the same: you feel the shock and notice the silence at first. Then trust builds.

That’s where the real insights show up. I overhear broken processes. I spot overlooked high performers. I see how things actually work. And I take action fast.

## The Power of 100+ 1:1s

When I take over a new org, I hold 1:1s with every single employee, one time 180 in 90 days. It’s painful, but it’s worth it.

The goal isn’t performance reviews or talent scouting. It’s simple: I want them to know I’m real. I want to establish trust, identify the influencers, and find the truth beneath the polished updates that hit my desk.

I tell them they can opt out. I won’t even know who said no. That alone builds credibility.

And when they share something shocking? I don’t run to their boss. I hold the line on confidentiality. Because if they trust me, they’ll tell me what’s really broken.

## Why This Works

- Messages move farther when they're carried by trusted voices
- Feedback gets sharper when people know you’re listening
- Trust isn’t built from a podium—it’s built shoulder-to-shoulder

I don’t rely on authority to drive alignment. I build connections and leverage the existing influencers. I call this playing chess not checkers. 

And the results speak for themselves.
