          <h3>What types of organizations benefit most from leadership development?</h3>
          <p>Organizations experiencing rapid growth, going through transformation, or struggling with leadership bench strength see the greatest impact. Our approach is especially effective for teams with innovative thinkers who don't thrive in traditional leadership models.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How is your leadership development approach different?</h3>
          <p>Unlike standardized leadership training, our approach starts with the premise that unconventional thinking is an advantage, not a liability. We don't fix "weaknesses" - we build systems that leverage natural strengths and create psychological safety for innovation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is the typical ROI for leadership development programs?</h3>
          <p>Our clients typically see measurable improvements in retention (25-40% increase), employee engagement (15-30% improvement), and strategic initiative completion rates (30-50% faster). The financial impact varies by organization, but our average client realizes a 5-7x return on their investment within 12 months.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long does it take to see results?</h3>
