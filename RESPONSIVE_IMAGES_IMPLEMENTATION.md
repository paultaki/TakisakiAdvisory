## Implementation Pattern Used

```html
<img 
  src="/insights/images/[name].webp"
  srcset="/insights/images/[name]-mobile.webp 400w,
          /insights/images/[name]-tablet.webp 800w,
          /insights/images/[name].webp [actual-width]w"
  sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw,
         (max-width: 1024px) 50vw,
         [desktop-size]"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="[description]">
```

## Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced Mobile Data Usage**
   - Mobile users will download 400px wide images instead of 1600px
   - ~75% reduction in image size for mobile devices

2. **Faster Initial Page Load**
   - Hero images load with high priority
   - Below-fold images load lazily as needed

3. **Improved Core Web Vitals**
   - Better Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   - Reduced Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
   - Lower Total Blocking Time (TBT)

## Next Steps

### Required: Generate Responsive Image Versions
You need to create the following image variations:

1. **Mobile versions (400w)**
   - Suffix: -mobile.webp
   - Width: 400px
   - Quality: 85%

2. **Tablet versions (800w)**
   - Suffix: -tablet.webp
   - Width: 800px
   - Quality: 90%

3. **Keep originals as desktop versions**

### Image Generation Script Example
```bash
# Using ImageMagick to create responsive versions
for img in *.webp; do
  # Mobile version
  convert "$img" -resize 400x -quality 85 "${img%.webp}-mobile.webp"
  
  # Tablet version
  convert "$img" -resize 800x -quality 90 "${img%.webp}-tablet.webp"
done
```
