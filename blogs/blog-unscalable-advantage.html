          <p>I ran a 400-person org.</p>

          <p>
            Sr. Directors, Directors, Managers. Reps. Coast to coast. All eyes
            on performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I still made time for 1:1s with people three layers down. Not
            because I had the time. Because I had a responsibility.

          <h2>The Scalability Trap</h2>

          <p>
            Leadership at scale is a trap. The bigger things get, the easier it
            is to hide behind dashboards, reports, and filtered feedback.
          </p>

          <p>
            You get polished presentations. You get secondhand updates. You get
            just enough truth to feel informed—but not enough to feel connected.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's why I kept showing up. In market. In the field. On calls. I
            wanted to hear the stories, not just the stats.
          </p>

          <p>
            My calendar was perpetually overbooked. My exec peers thought I was
            wasting time. "Delegate that," they'd say. "You can't scale
            yourself." They weren't wrong about the math. Four hundred people at
            30 minutes each is 200 hours. There's no way to make that add up.
          </p>

          <p>
            But here's what they missed: I wasn't trying to hold 400 1:1s. I was
            strategically connecting with people at all levels to maintain real
            connection to the frontline. The goal wasn't checking a box for
            everyone—it was preventing the isolation that happens to leaders who
            only talk to other leaders.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              When you only speak to people at your level, you only hear what
              people at your level want you to hear.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>The Story That Changed Everything</h3>

          <p>
            I remember sitting with a frontline rep who thought he was on his
            way out. Burnt out. Overlooked. Half in.
          </p>

          <p>All I did was listen.</p>

          <p>
            Two quarters later, he was one of our top performers. Not because I
            gave him a new playbook. Because someone finally gave a damn.
          </p>

          <p>That's the unscalable advantage.</p>

          <p>
            In a world obsessed with automation, AI, and efficiency, genuine
            human connection becomes the rarest resource. The executives who
            maintain it have an edge that no algorithm can match.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Scale the Unscalable</h2>

          <p>
            I'm not suggesting every leader can or should try to meet with
            hundreds of people. But there are practical ways to maintain
            connection without burning out:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Meetings with Purpose</h3>

          <p>
            I structured my skip-level 1:1s using a blend of heart and process.
            Salespeople are emotionally sharp—masters at reading energy, bending
            narratives, and influencing decisions. I know because I am one. So I
            had to design a system that cut through the noise without dulling
            the humanity.
          </p>

          <p>
            I used Excel to track all skip-level meetings across the org.
            Everyone got the same handful of questions. This wasn’t robotic—it
            was strategic. I wanted to remove bias, pattern-match themes, and
            protect my time from being hijacked by the most compelling
            storytellers. Unless it was critical, I wasn’t solving individual
            pain points—I was solving for patterns.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              "What’s one policy or process that makes your job harder than it
              needs to be?"
            </li>
            <li>
              "If you were in my position for a day, what’s the first thing
              you’d change?"
            </li>
            <li>"What do customers tell you that leadership never hears?"</li>
            <li>
              "What’s something we used to do well that we’ve stopped doing?"
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Then I sat in the cubicles—not the conference rooms. When I visited
            remote offices, I didn’t announce it. I’d set up shop in an empty
            desk and plug in my laptop. No entourage. No title. Just another
            teammate.
          </p>

          <p>
            They were shocked at first. But as soon as they saw I wasn’t there
            to micromanage or judge, they started talking. Some days I wanted
            earmuffs—what they said was brutally honest. But I didn’t flinch,
            didn’t gossip, and didn’t break trust. That’s why they kept telling
            me the truth.
          </p>

          <p>
            These conversations weren’t just therapeutic for them—they were
            transformative for me. I heard passion behind the problems. I asked
            real-time clarifying questions. I absorbed the full context, not
            just the surface issue.
          </p>

          <p>
            It wasn’t just the sitting—it was what followed. I never
            overreacted. I never broke confidence. Even when it was hilarious or
            wild, I didn’t run to their manager. That’s why they kept being
            honest. And that honesty shaped some of the best initiatives I ever
            rolled out.
          </p>

          <p>Presence doesn’t scale. But it sticks.</p>

          <p>
            I used a system I called "structured randomization." Each quarter,
            I'd meet with:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>5 high-potential employees identified by their managers</li>
            <li>
              5 employees selected completely at random from the org chart
            </li>
            <li>3 employees who had recently solved significant problems</li>
            <li>2 employees who had expressed concern or frustration</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This mix prevented me from only hearing from "favorites" or
            high-performers while ensuring I maintained a real pulse on the
            organization.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Making the Most of Travel</h3>

          <p>
            When I traveled to regional offices, I'd block half a day for
            consecutive 15-minute conversations with frontline team members.
            These weren't formal meetings—just genuine check-ins. I'd ask about
            their challenges, listen to their ideas, and often walk away with
            more valuable insights than I got from formal business reviews.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Digital Openness</h3>

          <p>
            I maintained an "Ask Me Anything" digital channel where anyone in
            the organization could submit questions—anonymously if they
            preferred. Once a month, I'd answer them in a video recording that
            everyone could access. This created a culture of transparency and
            helped surface issues I might never have discovered otherwise.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The most valuable information in your organization rarely makes it
              up the chain of command unless you intentionally create pathways
              for it.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Culture Lives in the In-Between Moments</h2>

          <p>
            Culture doesn't live in strategy decks. It lives in the in-between
            moments:
          </p>

          <p>A real check-in when someone's off.</p>

          <p>A note when someone crushes it.</p>

          <p>A conversation that says, "I see you."</p>

          <p>The higher you go, the more dangerous it gets to forget that.</p>

          <p>
            So yeah, scale matters. But if you lose the thread of connection,
            the whole thing unravels.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'd rather build something a little slower, a little messier—if it
            means the people inside it actually want to stay.
          </p>

          <p>Because loyalty isn't built by perks. It's built by presence.</p>

          <p>And presence doesn't scale. But it sticks.</p>
