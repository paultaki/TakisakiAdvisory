        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Analysis of customer data revealed a troubling pattern: a
          disproportionate number of new B2B customers were churning within
          their first 90 days after activation. This early churn represented
          millions in lost lifetime revenue and created significant
          inefficiencies as sales teams spent valuable selling time attempting
          to salvage troubled accounts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Drilling deeper into the data, I discovered that the root cause wasn't
          product quality or pricing—it was a fundamental disconnect between the
          sales promise and the customer experience. Our sales teams were
          excellent at closing deals but lacked the structure, time, and
          sometimes expertise to ensure smooth implementation and customer
          adoption.
        </p>

        <div class="phase-card">

            <div class="phase-number">1</div>
            <h3 class="phase-heading">No Structured Handoff Process</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            After signing the contract, customers often felt abandoned, with no
            clear guidance on next steps or who to contact with questions. Our
            data showed that nearly 40% of customers who churned early had made
            at least three support calls in their first 30 days, indicating
            confusion about basic setup and usage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="phase-card">

            <h3 class="phase-heading">Sales Team Time Sink</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Sales representatives were spending significant time on post-sale
            implementation activities rather than selling. This created two
            problems: sales productivity decreased, and the customer experience
            was inconsistent since reps lacked specialized onboarding expertise.
          </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="phase-heading">Activation and Process Failures</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            We identified a 25% rate of activation failures, with recurring
            issues related to ports, promotion fallout, and eSIM setup. These
            technical problems were causing significant customer frustration and
            contributing to early churn. Without a dedicated team focusing on
            these issues, they continued to plague new customers.

            <h3 class="phase-heading">No Early Warning System</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            Without a proactive check-in process, we had no way to identify
            at-risk customers until they were already calling to cancel. By that
            point, recovery was difficult and costly, resulting in lost revenue
            and damaged relationships.

            "The sales-to-service handoff was our blind spot. We were fantastic
            at closing deals and had strong ongoing support, but those critical
            first 90 days were a vulnerability that was costing us millions in
            lifetime customer value."

        <h2>The Solution</h2>

          I developed a comprehensive business case for a specialized Customer
          Success function that would provide structured, white-glove onboarding
          with five proactive touchpoints over 90 days. This wasn't just about
          satisfaction—it was about creating customers who would stay, grow, and
          advocate for us.

              establish a clear communication channel for any immediate

              Securing resources for a new team in our cost-conscious
              environment required a compelling business case with clear ROI
              projections. I developed a comprehensive analysis that quantified:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Revenue Protection</strong> — Calculated the lifetime
                value of customers we were losing in the first 90 days and
                projected retention improvements based on a detailed analysis of
                8,479 accounts with Customer Success support versus 13,503
                accounts without it.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Operational Savings</strong> — Estimated reductions in
                support calls (25% reduction in call volume), activation
                failures (25% reduction), and billing disputes (50% reduction in
                promo correction requests).
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Sales Productivity Gains</strong> — Quantified the
                selling time that would be recaptured by relieving reps of
                post-sale administrative work, showing the CS team could save
                approximately 2,040 hours per month, equating to $2M in annual
                SAM payroll.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Customer Experience Improvements</strong> — Projected
                NPS increases and their downstream impact on referral business,
                with our pilot achieving a perfect 5/5 rating on all customer
                surveys.
              </li>
            </ul>

              secured approval for a pilot program with a team structured around
              geographic support ratios of 1.75 Customer Success Reps for every
              Mid-Market Director, with a total of 30 CSRs (4 Senior Managers/1

        <h3>Team Structure and Objectives</h3>

          With approval secured, I focused on building a team with clear

        <h3>Job Responsibilities Overview</h3>
        <p>
          The Customer Success Team was designed with specific responsibilities
          across multiple service areas, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>New Customer Onboarding</strong> - Onboard new logos (15+
            per CSR), manage existing customer ports (15+), handle One Talk
            (5+), FWA (5+), and mmW (1+) activations
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Engagement Flow</strong> - Manage communication through SFDC
            with a defined escalation process
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Structured Timeline</strong> - Follow the 5-stage journey
            map from 0-1 day post-sale through 35-40 days with ongoing support
            as needed
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Training was intensive and immersive. Team members shadowed top sales
          reps to understand the selling process, spent time with technical
          support to build product knowledge, and received specialized training
          on identifying at-risk behaviors. The goal was to create a team that
          could serve as knowledgeable guides through the critical early
          customer journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most importantly, we established a robust feedback system. Every
          interaction was documented in our CRM, and weekly team meetings
          included a structured review of emerging patterns. This allowed us to
          quickly identify and address systemic issues rather than simply
          treating symptoms.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Productivity Gains</strong> — The CS team saved
            approximately 2,040 hours per month for sales reps, equivalent to $2
            million in annual payroll savings. Average case handling improved
            from 17 hours to just 8 hours per customer.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Dramatic Churn Reduction</strong> — Analysis comparing
            CS-engaged accounts (95) vs. non-CS engaged accounts (173) showed
            dramatically lower churn rates, resulting in an estimated 3,123
            saved lines in year one, representing $116,800 in monthly recurring
            revenue or $14 million in lifetime revenue.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Process Improvements</strong> — We documented a 25%
            reduction in activation failures, 25% reduction in call volume, and
            50% reduction in promo correction requests. One-day resolutions
            increased by more than 50%.

          <li>
            <strong>Sales Performance Boost</strong> — In 2023, 60% of sales
            reps participating with at least one CS case showed substantially
            better results, with those having 6+ CS engagements averaging 116%
            of their net add target and 479% of their New Logo gross add
            attainment for the year.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Digital Adoption Boost</strong> — Customers who went through
            our digital tool training used online self-service 47-70% of the
            time versus 9-20% for those who didn't receive training, further
            reducing support costs.

        <h3>The Feedback Loop: A Hidden Benefit</h3>
        <p>
          Perhaps the most valuable long-term impact was the systematic feedback
          mechanism we established. By meticulously documenting every issue
          encountered, the Customer Success Team became a powerful insights
          engine that drove improvements across multiple departments:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Product Development</strong> — Identified frequent usability
            challenges that informed product updates and feature priorities.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Operations</strong> — Spotted patterns in shipping and
            activation processes that led to streamlined procedures, including
            alignment with O+O in BGCO for escalation of failed activations,
            alignment with BFO for escalations related to promo corrections, and
            alignment with PACT for port issue escalations.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Sales Enablement</strong> — Provided insights on which
            promises caused downstream satisfaction issues, leading to improved
            training and messaging.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Resource Alignment</strong> — Created clear processes for
            working across teams including Sales Engineering, GTS, BGCO, PACT,
            L&D and Operations to solve complex customer issues more
            effectively.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This feedback loop created a virtuous cycle where the entire customer
          experience continually improved, not just the onboarding phase. We
          also identified impactful pilot insights such as One Talk Zero Use
          reduction (from 32% to 8% through proactive engagement) and better
          partner alignment—we found 27% of accounts not properly set up were
          actually working with a partner, allowing us to coordinate support
          more effectively.

        <p>
          With a total investment of approximately $3.25 million generating over
          $17 million in benefits, the program achieved an ROI of more than 5:1
          in its first year alone. Based on year two projections of $53 million
          in protected revenue, this ratio would improve dramatically over time.
          The initiative was expanded from the pilot team to a nationwide
          deployment, and eventually became standard practice for B2B customer
          onboarding across Verizon.

          <p>
            The early-churn pattern was hiding in plain sight within our
            customer data, but it took deliberate analysis to recognize it as a
            systemic issue rather than individual customer decisions. By
            analyzing patterns across thousands of accounts, we identified a
            fixable structural problem and tracked results with specific metrics
            that proved the impact.

          <p>
            In a resource-constrained environment, leading with a rigorous
            business case was critical. By quantifying both the problem cost and
            solution benefits, I secured buy-in for an innovative approach that
            might otherwise have been dismissed as a "nice to have" rather than
            a strategic imperative. Having actual case studies and pilot data
            further strengthened the business case.

            The sales team wasn't failing at onboarding because they lacked

            function. Creating a dedicated team with focused expertise and clear
            metrics led to dramatically better outcomes than trying to make
            everyone good at everything. The structured approach allowed for
