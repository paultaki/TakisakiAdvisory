          because I had the time. Because I had a responsibility.

        <h2>The Scalability Trap</h2>

        <p>
          Leadership at scale is a trap. The bigger things get, the easier it is
          to hide behind dashboards, reports, and filtered feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          You get polished presentations. You get secondhand updates. You get
          just enough truth to feel informed—but not enough to feel connected.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's why I kept showing up. In market. In the field. On calls. I
          wanted to hear the stories, not just the stats.
        </p>

        <p>
          My calendar was perpetually overbooked. My exec peers thought I was
          wasting time. "Delegate that," they'd say. "You can't scale yourself."
          They weren't wrong about the math. Four hundred people at 30 minutes
          each is 200 hours. There's no way to make that add up.
        </p>

        <p>
          But here's what they missed: I wasn't trying to hold 400 1:1s. I was
          strategically connecting with people at all levels to maintain real
          connection to the frontline. The goal wasn't checking a box for
          everyone—it was preventing the isolation that happens to leaders who
          only talk to other leaders.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            When you only speak to people at your level, you only hear what
            people at your level want you to hear.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>The Story That Changed Everything</h3>

        <p>
          I remember sitting with a frontline rep who thought he was on his way
          out. Burnt out. Overlooked. Half in.
        </p>

        <p>All I did was listen.</p>

        <p>
          Two quarters later, he was one of our top performers. Not because I
          gave him a new playbook. Because someone finally gave a damn.
        </p>

        <div class="blog-post-featured-text">
          That's the unscalable advantage.
        </div>

        <p>
          In a world obsessed with automation, AI, and efficiency, genuine human
          connection becomes the rarest resource. The executives who maintain it
          have an edge that no algorithm can match.

        <h2>Presence in Practice</h2>

        <p>
          I used a standard set of questions that let me spot patterns across
          the organization:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            "What's one policy or process that makes your job harder than it
            needs to be?"
          </li>
          <li>
            "If you were in my position for a day, what's the first thing you'd
            change?"
          </li>
          <li>"What do customers tell you that leadership never hears?"</li>
          <li>
            "What's something we used to do well that we've stopped doing?"
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Then I sat in the cubicles—not the conference rooms. When I visited
          remote offices, I wouldn't announce it. I'd set up shop in an empty
          desk and plug in my laptop. No entourage. No title. Just another
          teammate.
        </p>

        <p>
          They were shocked at first. But as soon as they saw I wasn't there to
          micromanage or judge, they started talking. Some days I wanted
          earmuffs—what they said was brutally honest. But I didn't flinch,
          didn't gossip, and didn't break trust. That's why they kept telling me
          the truth.
        </p>

        <p>A real check-in when someone's off.</p>

        <p>A note when someone crushes it.</p>

        <p>A conversation that says, "I see you."</p>
